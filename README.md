### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ myself Debadri!

## Who am I?

I am a Fullstack Developer by profession and a traveller :camping: by heart. Started out as a backend developer, hence took hours to even center align a button. Then started working on frontend under compulsion and now I am enjoying it :blush:. Currently I am equaly proficient in both BE & FE using multiple stacks and I also agree that JavaScript is weird but its fun. I hope my projects here on Github might help folks get ideas.

Here are some info about me:

- :computer: Iâ€™m currently working at TCS India.
- :globe_with_meridians: Check out my [website](https://www.debadri.com) and feel free to connect.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
- :partying_face: Don't forget to enjoy the life.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Time enjoyed is never wasted.
